<span style="color:#000000;font-family:Arial;font-size:16px;">What we are about:<br>We believe the sixty-six books of the Old and New Testaments are inspired in all their very words(1) by God, and inerrant(2) in the original manuscripts (autographs). These sixty-six books alone are the final authority in faith and life.<br><br>We believe in one God who is Creator of heaven and earth. He is infinite Spirit, eternal, almighty, and infallible, including His omniscience and knowledge of all future events. He is unchangeable in His essence, and all wise, just, and holy. The triune God eternally exists in one essence and three Persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. God intervenes in the universe in many ways.<br><br>We believe in the ex-nihilo special creation of the universe and in the supernatural creation of many diverse biological categories. We also believe in the historicity of the biblical record, including the special creation of Adam and Eve (the first human male and female) as the literal progenitors of all humans.(3)<br><br>We believe in Jesus Christ, the Second Person of the Trinity, the Eternal Word manifested in the flesh. He was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the virgin Mary, lived a sinless life, and He is fully God and fully man, having two distinct natures co-joined in one Person. Jesus died as a representative and substitutionary sacrifice for human sins and offers salvation by grace alone. He arose from the dead in the same physical body, though glorified, in which He had lived and died, and His resurrection body is the pattern of that body which will be given to each believer. Christ ascended into heaven, showing the perfection of His redemptive work. He will literally and bodily return to earth to finalize the divine plan for humanity.<br><br>While not a doctrinal issue, our ministry is eclectic in its methodology of apologetics and evangelism. Christianity can be supported in many ways, including classical and presuppositional apologetic methods (exclusive reliance on one approach is unwise). Humans, though corrupted by sin, can acquire important, but limited, knowledge from nature that points to God. Accordingly, we affirm the use of both natural revelation (nature) and special revelation (Scripture) to reason toward Christianity.</span></div>
